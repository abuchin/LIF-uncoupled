# LIF-uncoupled

This code generates the population of LIF and IF neural neurons reciving the noisy input. Using this code you could see how 
the population firing-rate saturates when you increase the number of neurons in case of leaky (LIF) and perfect (IF) integrators. This code
has been used for simulations in the following work: http://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S1060992X10020074

If you plan to use it for your research, please, do not forget to cite this publication.
